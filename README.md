👋 Hi, I’m @WuGing

🌱 I’m currently working on improving Data Structure projects from my Algorithm and Data Structure class in College. 
In addition, I'm periodically reviewing my VM & Compiler from my capstone, and looking for way to improve it,
as well as working on my obs-react project, which I use for live streaming on Twitch.

💞️ I've been enjoying working on my Twitch overlay, learning the ins and outs of the Twitch API, and how to 
display events visually for viewers. 

📫 I can be reached at jds.sutherland@gmail.com.
Recruiters/Interviewers, please reach out for access to private projects such as my VM & Compiler.
