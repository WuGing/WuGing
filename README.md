👋 Hi, I’m @WuGing

🌱 Most currently working on an Azure DevOps API Client .NET library: learning about OpenAPI, GitHub Actions, and NuGet package publishing. Long term I plan to use this knowledge for an iOS app to interface with Azure DevOps. 
Additionally finding time to build Linq Extension libaries, improve my Data Structure projects from my Algorithm and Data Structure college class, and reviewing my VM & Compiler from my capstone, and looking for way to improve it. (Rewrite in a public C#, chat?)

💞️ Catch my occassional streams on Twitch and YouTube.

📫 I can be reached at recruit@wuging.dev.
Recruiters/Interviewers, please reach out for access to private projects such as my VM & Compiler.
